# FIRE-DETECTION-SYSTEM-USING-YOLOV9-APPROACH
##  PROBLEM STATEMENT
Discussing how fire-related incidents pose a danger to life and property, and how early detection can prevent disaster. Emphasize the need for a smart, scalable software-based fire detection solution.

## OBJECTIVE 
To create a real-time fire detection and alert system using YOLOv9. The system should be capable of detecting fire through video feeds and sending alerts to concerned authorities.

##  KEY FEATURES
* Fire detection using real-time camera feed.

* Pre-trained YOLOv9 model for high accuracy.

* Email alert system integration.

* Location tracking for faster response.

* Easy integration with existing CCTV systems.

##  Tech Stack
* Python (OpenCV, Flask)

* YOLOv9 (trained on fire dataset)

* Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for model testing)
